Both of these Millestones I had to turn lights on (blue light and red light), on my bread board. I was able to go deep inside of the multiple folders to turn on each of the lights, as well as making them blink and turning them off. The help of my professor was such a great asset when it came to finding the folders in which the lights belonged. Learning that you have to code in the folders to open the inside to get the file, is a transferable skill that I will be able to take with me throughout thte technology space. By me making my code clean, clear, and concise is how my code was able to be readable, adaptable, as well as maintainable.
